# How to recognise faces
* Get pictures
* Detect faces
* Crop faces
* Make them grayscale
* adjust the face in the picture (rotate and move)
* Remove wrongly detected pictures
* use Eigenfaces or Fisherfaces to get values
* train Machine-Learning algorithm on these values with categories (k-nearest neighbour, SVM)
* detect, crop, and adjust on test-pictures
* test if test-pictures are detected
 
# General stuff
* Test different Algorithms
* Create Graphs
